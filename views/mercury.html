<h2>Mercury</h2>
<img src="/img/mercury.png" alt="Mercury" width="600"/>
<p>Mercury is the first of our nine planets in the solar system, and the closest one to the sun. 
It also happens to be the smallest planet. Althout it is closest to the sun, Venus is actually hotter 
than Mercury beause it has a solid surface unlike Venus. The size of Mercury is only a bit larger than 
our moon. It takes about 88 earth days for Mercury to make a full revolution around the sun.</p>
