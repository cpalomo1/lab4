<p>Venus is the second planet in our solar system. 
It neighbors Earth and is the hottest planet because its atmosphere is made up of carbon dioxide and 
sulfraid acid. One intersting thing about Venus is that it spins in th opposite direction of most other 
planets. Venus has many mountain and volcanos on its surface as well. A year on Venus takes 225 earth 
days, and a rotations (or day) takes 117 earth days which means a year on Venus has 2 only sunrises! </p>
